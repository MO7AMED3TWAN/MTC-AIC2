# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) System

This repository contains The code Of using the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system that we built to predict text for Arabic audio in the Egyptian dialect.

It is provided to senior management of the MTC-AIC 2 competition

## Overview

This Notebook demonstrates how to Load audio data, load a pre-trained ASR model, predict transcripts from audio files, and save results to a CSV file.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- pandas

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MO7AMED3TWAN/MTC-AIC2.git

cd MTC-AIC2

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

#### Project Structure

- **Data/**: Put your Test Audios There.
- **Models/**: There You Will find The Model And Configuration Of It.
- **Output/**: There You Will Get Your Predictable Transcript For Your Audios Files.

#### Project Workflow

1. Place your test audio files (in WAV format) in the `Data` directory.
2. Run the notebook or script `PredictText.ipynb` to generate transcripts.
3. Predictions will be saved to `./Output/predictions.csv`.
